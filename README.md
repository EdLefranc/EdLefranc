- 👋 Hi, I’m @EdLefranc, I am a musician, writer and manga artist.
- 👀 I’m interested in all programming... and obviously... videogames.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavasCript (in final instances), Python and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project, whatever, I want to learn!!
- 📫 How to reach me: It can be by email, I usually check every day. Or by this means, I try every time to make it more a part of me.

- PD: I hope to make many friends! =)
